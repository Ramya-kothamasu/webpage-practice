                <h2><u>Importance of National Flag:</u></h2>

                <p>The National Flag of India, known as the Tiranga, is a proud symbol of the country’s sovereignty, unity, and values. 
                    Its three colors — saffron at the top, white in the middle, and green at the bottom — represent courage and sacrifice, 
                    peace and truth, and growth and prosperity respectively. 
                    The navy blue Ashoka Chakra at the center of the white band symbolizes the eternal wheel of law, righteousness,
                    and progress.
                    The flag is a reminder of India’s long struggle for freedom and the sacrifices made by countless brave souls. 
                    It inspires feelings of patriotism and pride, and encourages every citizen to uphold the ideals of justice, 
                    equality, and harmony. The Tiranga is not just a piece of cloth — it is a living symbol of India’s rich

                <h2><u>History of National Symbols:</u></h2>
                <p>
                    India’s national symbols — including the National Flag, National Song, and National Anthem — reflect the 
                    country’s identity, values, and rich cultural heritage. The National Flag, the Tiranga, was officially 
                    adopted on 22 July 1947 by the Constituent Assembly. The three colors — saffron, white, and green — stand 
                    for courage and sacrifice, peace and truth, and faith and prosperity. The flag’s center features the Ashoka
                    Chakra, a navy blue wheel with 24 spokes, derived from the Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath.
                    The 24 spokes of the Ashoka Chakra represent the eternal wheel of law (Dharma Chakra). Each spoke symbolizes
                    a principle such as justice, courage, patience, truthfulness, compassion, and righteousness. The Chakra 
                    reminds citizens of the importance of constant progress and the path of dharma (righteousness). 
                    The National Anthem, "Jana Gana Mana", composed by Rabindranath Tagore in 1911, and the National Song, 
                    "Vande Mataram", written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay in 1876, also played a vital role in inspiring 
                    unity and patriotism during the freedom struggle.
                    Together, these national symbols reflect India’s unity in diversity, its ancient heritage, and its aspirations as a modern nation.

                <h3><b> Difference Between Independence Day and Republic Day (Plain Text) </b></h3>

                <p>
               
                    Independence Day and Republic Day are two of the most important national festivals of India, both celebrating the nation’s journey towards freedom and democracy. 
                    However, they mark different milestones in India’s history and have distinct significance.

                </p>

                <ul>

                    <li><b>Independence Day (15th August)</b></li>

                </ul>
                <p>

                    Independence Day is celebrated on 15th August every year to commemorate India’s freedom from British rule in 1947.
                    It marks the end of over 200 years of colonial rule and the birth of a free nation. On this day, 
                    the Prime Minister hoists the National Flag at the Red Fort in Delhi and addresses the nation. 
                    The day is observed with flag hoisting ceremonies, 
                    parades, cultural programs, and remembrance of the sacrifices made by freedom fighters.

                    <li><b>Republic Day (26th January)</b></li>

                </ul>
                    <p>Republic Day is celebrated on 26th January to honor the day when the Constitution of India came into effect in 
                    1950, making India a sovereign, democratic republic. While Independence Day marks freedom from foreign rule, 
                    Republic Day marks the adoption of the nation’s own governing framework. The main celebration takes place at 
                    Rajpath in New Delhi, with a grand parade showcasing India’s cultural diversity, military strength, and 
                    achievements. 
                    The President of India unfurls the flag and presides over the ceremonies.</p>
